# Deployment behavior
An instance executing this box will use bash scripting to install and configure Magento. It also stacks Nginx, PHP-FPM and NFS client boxes to support its complete behavior.  

Box events handle the Magento instance lifecycle as follows:

+ **Install** operation:
    * *install event script:* installs epel repository package, creates magento directory and changes its ownership to nginx.NGINX_USER and nginx.NGINX_GROUP.
+ **Configure** operation:
	* *configure event script:* downloads and configures the configuration's files (i.e. nginx.conf, local.xml) and saves them into nginx and magento directories respectively.

# Supported Distributions
The box supports deploying to these linux distributions:

* Amazon Linux AMI 2015.03
* Centos 6.5, 7
* RedHat 7
