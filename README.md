This is DevOps for CLC API and work being done in Elasticbox.
I am going to using git to insure work is replicated and controlled. 

Folder structures are properly named.

1)  For API v1 examples, look in CLCAPIV1
Be reminded, these are all python based
  
2)  Magento code provided by Diego and EB team - for use ebcli.

3)  For API v2 examples, look in CLCAPIV2
Again, all python examples.
